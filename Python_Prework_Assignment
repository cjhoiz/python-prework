# Question 1
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function.

def hello_name(user_name):
    print("Hello_" + user_name.upper() + "!")                 # prints the username provided to all capital letters with .upper() method

hello_name('chris')


# Question 2
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

def first_odds():
    for num in range(101):                                    # sets range from 1 to 100.  Set to 101 since range max value is 1 less than the argument input.
        if num % 2 != 0:                                      # if num divided by 2 yields a dividend, the number will be printed.  If not, goes to next number
            print(num)

first_odds()

# Question 3
# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list.

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    max = a_list[0]                                           # sets max value to the 0th position of the list
    for num in a_list:                                        # goes through each number in a_list

            max = num                                         # sets max to the new value in a_list if the above if statement is true

a_list = [5, 6, 7, 10, 1, 2, 3]
print(max_num_in_list([5, 6, 7, 10, 1, 2, 3]))
print("The largest number in the list is:", max_num_in_list(a_list))      # Two ways to print out the information depending on how you want it presented.



# Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

def is_leap_year(a_year):
    if a_year % 100 == 0 and a_year % 400 == 0:                # Tests for divisible by 100 AND divisible by 400, making it a century and a leap year
        print(str(a_year) + " is a century leap year!")
    elif a_year % 4 == 0 and a_year % 100 != 0:                # Tests for divisible by 4 AND NOT divisible by 100, making it a leap year
        print(str(a_year) + " is a leap year!")
    else:
        print(str(a_year) + " is not a leap year!")

is_leap_year(2000)
is_leap_year(1987)
is_leap_year(2004)
is_leap_year(1900)



# Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.

def is_consecutive(a_list):
    sorted_a_list = sorted(a_list)                                # sorts list in order
    test_a_list = list(range(min(a_list), max(a_list) + 1))       # makes a test list in the range of the minimum of the list to the maximum + 1 to make sure the list is the same length since range will give 1 less than the length of a_list
    if sorted_a_list == test_a_list:                              # tests for sort_a_list being the same as test_a_list
        return True
    else:
        return False

consecutive_test = is_consecutive([1,2,4,5,3])
non_consecutive_test = is_consecutive([1,2,4,5,7])
print(consecutive_test)
print(non_consecutive_test)
